# OOP_PROJECT_Mad-Animals
Mad Animals is an exciting game developed during my third semester at Habib University for the Object Oriented Programming course. 
With meticulously designed modules, including captivating game characters, immersive gameplay mechanics, and visually stunning graphics, Mad Animals offers an exhilarating gaming experience.

In the development of the 'Mad Animals' game, we implemented several design patterns, including the Singleton design pattern. This pattern is used to ensure that only one instance of a class is created and that it is globally accessible throughout the program. We used this pattern in the creation of the game manager class to manage different aspects of the game, including player information, scores, and progress.

Additionally, we utilized various modules to ensure a seamless and immersive gaming experience. These modules included the user interface, character movement, collision detection, and sound effects. Each of these modules was designed using object-oriented principles, including inheritance, and polymorphism, to ensure a flexible and modular structure for the game.

The user interface module was responsible for the creation of the game's menus, including the main menu, level selection, and pause menu. We used a combination of graphics libraries and C++ code to ensure that the interface was user-friendly and responsive.

The character movement module was designed to ensure that the game characters moved smoothly and seamlessly throughout the game. This module utilized concepts such as vectors, gravity, and velocity to simulate real-world movements.

Collision detection was implemented to ensure that game characters did not move through each other or through the game environment. We utilized different collision detection algorithms to ensure that collisions were detected accurately and efficiently.

Lastly, sound effects were implemented to provide an immersive experience for the player. This module utilized a combination of pre-recorded sounds and synthesized audio to provide a rich and engaging soundscape for the game.
